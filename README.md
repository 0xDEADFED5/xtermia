## xtermia, an xterm.js webclient for Evennia
This replaces the webclient of an [Evennia](https://github.com/evennia/evennia/tree/main) game with the [xterm.js](https://github.com/xtermjs/xterm.js) terminal emulator.
This is a demo that you can copy over a freshly initialized Evennia game.

### Features
- No more input box, type directly into the terminal like it's 1984
- Does terminal stuff
- Optional persistent map display
    - send 'map' command to webclient with your map to update the cached map
    - map will be centered in right half of terminal
	- map can be enabled/disabled/updated at will
    - (see [examples.py](commands/examples.py))
- Up/down arrow to scroll through command history
- Start typing to see completion suggestions, use right arrow or Tab to accept the suggestion
- You can hold Enter to spam commands now or type anything else to overwrite last command
- Ctrl+C to copy, Ctrl+V to paste in addition to the right-click copy/paste
- Clickable web links
- Completion suggestions based on Evennia commands available at login
- Client side options for font size, screenreader, etc. see enter :help for a command list
- Tells Evennia the terminal width/height at startup and on resize
- Won't echo commands or add to command history until after login (won't echo password)
- Sound/music (see [examples.py](commands/examples.py))
- Interactive terminal mode (see [examples.py](commands/examples.py)) for an example, or type 'interact' in the game
- All files are local, no internet required
- Uses [Fira Code](https://github.com/tonsky/FiraCode) font because it has great box drawing characters
